# Netflix Clone

This project is a Netflix clone implemented in Swift, utilizing CoreData for persistent storage. The project is inspired by https://github.com/amrhossam96/Netflix-clone/tree/master but has been customized and extended to demonstrate my own implementation.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays a variety of movies and TV shows in different categories, such as trending, popular, and upcoming.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies and TV shows by title.
- **Watchlist**: Add movies and TV shows to your personal watchlist for easy access later.
- **Movie/TV Show Details**: View detailed information about a selected movie or TV show, including a trailer preview.
- **CoreData Integration**: All user data, watchlist, and preferences are stored using CoreData for persistent local storage.
